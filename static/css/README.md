# STATIC

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your static css files.
Each file inside this directory is mapped to `/css/`.
Thus you'd want to delete this README.md before deploying to production.

Example: `/static/css/libraries.css` is mapped as `/css/libraries.css`.
